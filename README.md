# StudyPath
StudyPath converts a textbook PDF into a personalised study plan. FastAPI plus SQLite handle PDF parsing and Groq-powered baseline quizzes, while the Vite/React UI guides learners from upload through assessment to a feasibility-aware schedule. All data stays local, and the project README explains setup and extension options.
